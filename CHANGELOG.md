# @bryanberger/mattermost-mcp

## 0.7.0 (fork)

- Replace the automatic OpenCode inbox with a private rolling 48-hour SQLite cache for incoming and outgoing messages across joined conversations. Cache reads support combined filters and pagination.
- Add opt-in, expiring callback subscriptions for an OpenCode session or an explicitly allowed webhook. Nothing is delivered without a registration. See [examples and upgrade notes](docs/shared-service.md#pull-or-subscribe).

## 0.6.0 (fork)

- Share one Mattermost account across local MCP clients with the authenticated HTTP
  [service](docs/shared-service.md). The default stdio command still works.
- Deliver incoming DMs and personal mentions to a chosen OpenCode inbox with reconnect
  recovery and an ID-only outbox.
- For Oven Tunnel's older stdio-only aggregate bridge, the [integration patch](examples/gpttun-http.patch)
  adds HTTP support for the Mattermost upstream while preserving other upstreams.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/pull/8) [`0ccc540`](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/commit/0ccc54027a255c47e86cc9e932d4082b0972aaa8) Thanks [@BryanBerger98](https://github.com/BryanBerger98)! - Improve the `login` auth UX:
  - **Default browser** — `login --gitlab` now drives your OS default browser when it is Chromium-based
    (Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Arc, Dia…), falling back to the first installed
    Chromium engine. Override with `MM_CHROME_PATH`. Detection is best-effort and degrades gracefully.
  - **`gitlab` in the menu** — `gitlab / SSO` is now a selectable option in `mattermost-mcp login`
    (after entering the server URL), in addition to the `--gitlab` / `--sso` flag.
  - **Keyboard-navigable picker** — the auth-mode selector is now an arrow-key menu (↑/↓ or `j`/`k`,
    digits to jump, Enter to confirm, Esc/Ctrl-C to abort), with a numbered fallback for non-TTY input.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/pull/6) [`0f7464b`](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/commit/0f7464b3f373203a6de0552ba33252fa248f741b) Thanks [@BryanBerger98](https://github.com/BryanBerger98)! - Add `mattermost-mcp login --gitlab` (alias `--sso`): a browser-driven SSO login for servers whose
  only login path is an external IdP (e.g. GitLab) when you are **not** an admin — so Personal Access
  Tokens and OAuth2 apps (both admin-gated) are unavailable. It opens the system Chrome/Chromium at
  `{server}/login`, waits for you to complete the SSO login, reads the resulting `MMAUTHTOKEN` session
  cookie via CDP, and saves it (0600) as a token. Chrome discovery honors `MM_CHROME_PATH`. Adds an
  optional, lazy-imported `puppeteer-core` dependency that never loads on the MCP server path.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/pull/4) [`da9d01f`](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/commit/da9d01fdfc9dcdacb21a29f8fa67a42ed5c9c91d) Thanks [@BryanBerger98](https://github.com/BryanBerger98)! - Add a management CLI to the `mattermost-mcp` binary. After `npm i -g @bryanberger/mattermost-mcp`, run `mattermost-mcp login` for an interactive auth wizard (PAT, password, or OAuth2) that validates and saves credentials (0600) under the config dir; the MCP server then uses them automatically — no env vars required. Also adds `status` (print the authenticated identity) and `logout` (clear saved credentials). `MM_*` environment variables still take precedence over saved credentials. Password logins are exchanged for a session token at login time, so no password is ever written to disk.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`fd203df`](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/commit/fd203df4f1289ab04e5fe0874657fe3fc17fbd04) Thanks [@BryanBerger98](https://github.com/BryanBerger98)! - Releases are now published via npm trusted publishing (OIDC) with automatic provenance. No functional changes to the server or tools.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/pull/1) [`4d5b2ed`](https://github.com/BryanBerger98/mattermost-mcp/commit/4d5b2edf637e7d795aceee9c939f9ebb82ae20a4) Thanks [@BryanBerger98](https://github.com/BryanBerger98)! - Initial public release. MCP (stdio) server exposing the Mattermost REST API v4 as 34 tools across messaging, channels/teams, users/presence, and files. Three auth modes (PAT, password, OAuth2 PKCE), guardrails (read-only + destructive-confirm), and transport resilience (retry with backoff + per-request timeout).
